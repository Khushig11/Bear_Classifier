# Bear Classifier

This repository contains a bear classifier which is a simple yet effective deep learning project that showcases the use of PyTorch and Fastai for image classification. 
The model is capable of distinguishing between 8 species of bears: Giant Panda, Speclated Bear, Sun Bear, Sloth Bear, American Black Bear, Asian Black Bear, Brown Bear and Polar Bear.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of bear images and can predict the species of a given bear image.

The classifier is built on the powerful Fastai library, making it easy to train and deploy.
